## üíª Tech Stack

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML5** | For the semantic structure of the gallery, icon cards, and modal. |
| **CSS3** | For the complete visual styling, including the dark mode, animations, and responsive grid layout. |
| **Vanilla JavaScript** | Powers all interactive logic, including the live search, filtering, modal functionality, and dynamic rendering of icons from a data source. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

No installation or complex setup is required to use this component.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ````bash
    git clone [https://github.com/fritzkmanurung/GlyphGrid.git](https://github.com/fritzkmanurung/GlyphGrid.git)
    ````
2.  **Navigate to the Directory**
    ````bash
    cd GlyphGrid
    ````
3.  **Open in Your Browser**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to see the gallery in action.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

This project is structured to be easily customizable.

1.  **Add Your Icons**: To add your own icons, simply modify the `icons` array at the top of the `<script>` tag in `index.html`. Each icon object should have an `id`, `name`, `desc`, `tags`, and `img` (URL to the icon image).
2.  **Customize Filters**: To change the filter categories, update the buttons in the `.filter-buttons` div in the HTML. Make sure the `data-filter` attribute matches the tags used in your icon data.
3.  **Integrate into a Project**: To use this in your own website, copy the relevant HTML structure, link the CSS file, and adapt the JavaScript logic to fit your needs.
